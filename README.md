# Nuxt 3 Minimal Starter

Look at the [Nuxt 3 documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more.

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:
```bash
# yarn
yarn
```
We use yarn instead of npm, its faster and has better security features. Further, the pinia framework could not be installed properly with npm.
IMPORTANT: don't mix npm and yarn, since this could lead to wrong dependencies.

## Development Server

Start the development server on http://localhost:3000

```bash
yarn run dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
yarn run build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
yarn run preview
```

Check out the [deployment documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deployment) for more information.
